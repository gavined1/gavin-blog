# Getting Started with Next.js 15: A Complete Guide

Next.js 15 is here, and it's packed with exciting new features and performance improvements that make building modern web applications even more enjoyable. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore everything you need to know to get started with Next.js 15.

## What's New in Next.js 15

Next.js 15 introduces several groundbreaking features that enhance both developer experience and application performance:

### 1. Enhanced App Router

The App Router has been significantly improved with better performance and more intuitive APIs. The new routing system provides:

- **Improved Caching**: Better cache management with more granular control
- **Enhanced Performance**: Faster page loads and smoother navigation
- **Better TypeScript Support**: Improved type safety and developer experience

### 2. New Image Optimization

Next.js 15 takes image optimization to the next level with:

- **AVIF Format Support**: Better compression and quality
- **Automatic Format Selection**: Choose the best format based on browser support
- **Enhanced Lazy Loading**: Smarter loading strategies for better performance

### 3. Improved Core Web Vitals

The latest version focuses heavily on Core Web Vitals optimization:

- **Faster First Contentful Paint (FCP)**
- **Improved Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**
- **Better Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) scores**

## Setting Up Your First Next.js 15 Project

Let's create a new Next.js 15 project and explore its features:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-nextjs15-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app
cd my-nextjs15-app
npm run dev
```

### Project Structure

Next.js 15 uses the App Router by default, which provides a more intuitive file-based routing system:

```
my-nextjs15-app/
├── app/
│   ├── globals.css
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── favicon.ico
├── public/
├── package.json
└── next.config.js
```

## Key Features and Best Practices

### 1. Server Components

Server Components are one of the most powerful features in Next.js 15:

```tsx
// app/posts/page.tsx
async function PostsPage() {
  const posts = await fetch("https://api.example.com/posts").then((res) =>
    res.json()
  );

  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <article key={post.id}>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          <p>{post.excerpt}</p>
        </article>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 2. Client Components

When you need interactivity, use Client Components:

```tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";

export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>;
}
```

### 3. Metadata API

Next.js 15's Metadata API makes SEO optimization easier:

```tsx
import { Metadata } from "next";

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "My Page",
  description: "This is my page description",
  openGraph: {
    title: "My Page",
    description: "This is my page description",
    images: ["/og-image.jpg"],
  },
};
```

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Image Optimization

Use the Next.js Image component for optimal performance:

```tsx
import Image from "next/image";

export function OptimizedImage() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/hero-image.jpg"
      alt="Hero image"
      width={800}
      height={600}
      priority
      sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw"
    />
  );
}
```

### 2. Font Optimization

Optimize your fonts for better performance:

```tsx
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";

const inter = Inter({
  subsets: ["latin"],
  display: "swap",
  preload: true,
});

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className={inter.className}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## SEO Best Practices

Next.js 15 makes SEO optimization straightforward:

### 1. Static Generation

Use Static Site Generation for better SEO:

```tsx
// This page will be statically generated at build time
export default function StaticPage() {
  return <div>This is a static page</div>;
}
```

### 2. Dynamic Metadata

Generate metadata dynamically:

```tsx
export async function generateMetadata({ params }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug);

  return {
    title: post.title,
    description: post.excerpt,
  };
}
```

## Deployment

Deploying your Next.js 15 application is straightforward:

### 1. Vercel (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

### 2. Other Platforms

Next.js 15 works with any platform that supports Node.js:

- **Netlify**: Great for static sites
- **AWS**: Use with AWS Amplify or Lambda
- **Docker**: Containerize your application
